Authors of research papers in the fields of mathematics, and other math-heavy disciplines commonly employ the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) scheme to search for relevant literature.
The MSC is a hierarchical alphanumerical classification scheme that allows librarians to specify one or multiple codes for publications.
Digital Mathematical Libraries and reviewing services, such as zbMATH and Mathematical Reviews (MR) rely on these the MSC in their workflows to organize abstracts and reviews.
Therefore the editors manually assign a coarse-grained classification that determines the subject editor, which then performs the fine-grained labeling.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of automatically assigning a coarse-grained primary classification, by regarding the problem as a multi class classification machine learning task.
We find that the most advanced methods achieve \(F_{1}\)-scores of over 77\%, which is remarkably close to the agreement of zbMATH and MR of 81\%.
Moreover, we find that the methods confidence score allows us the reduce the manual coarse-grained classification effort to 14\% while maintaining a precision of 81\% for the automatically classified articles.
