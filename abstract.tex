The mathematical subject classification MSC labels publications in mathematics research and related sciences.
Mathematical reviewing services such as zbMATH and Mathematical Reviews (MR) use the MSC to improve the discoverability of mathematical knowledge.
Currently, the assignment of subject classification labels is performed manually by domain experts.
In this paper, we investigate the ability to automatically perform a coarse-grained first-level primary classification of mathematical publications in zbMATH using state of the machine learning technology.
We find that most advanced methods achieve F1 scores of more than 77\%, which is remarkably close to the baseline of 81\% (the agreement of zbMATH and MR).
