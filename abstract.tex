The mathematical subject classification MSC labels publications in mathematics research and related sciences.
The hierarchical MSC is used by the mathematical reviewing services zbMATH and Mathematical Reviews to improve the discoverability of mathematical knowledge.
Currently, the assignment of subject classification labels is performed manually by domain experts.
In this paper, we investigate the ability to automatically perform a coarse-grained first-level primary classification of mathematical publications in zbMATH using state of the machine learning technology.
We find that most advanced neural networks achieve F1 scores of more than 78\%, which is remarkably close to the baseline of 81\%, which is can be obtained by using the labels of one reviewing service to predict the labels of the respective other service labels.
